###Mission
You are trying to store multiple callbacks in MyStruct and call them with a concrete type in the do_something method.
Specializing MyStruct (which is parametrized with the argument type of the closure) introduced a lifetime issue that has to be fixed.

###Goal:
- Please detail what is the problem in a specific text file
- Provide a solution that you would propose to fix it
- Add the patched code and documentation
- you are only allowed to modify the file src/changeme.rs
- Provide us a git patch with your work!

in Rust Langugage lifetimes ensure that references are valid for as long as they are used. 
The error you're seeing means that **the compiler can't guarantee that a reference used inside a method will stay valid as long as another reference it's compared to** .

### Solution Proposal
`Arc` (Atomic Reference Counting)  , can improve the Rust program's handling of shared state, particularly in concurrent situations ,  when multiple parts of the code need to access the same data . 

| **Original Problem** | Solution with `Arc` | **Benefits** |
|--|--|--|
| The `MyCallbackData` struct previously held a reference (`&'a [u8]`) to a slice of data (`data`) within `MyStruct`. | **Wrap Data with `Arc`:** The `get_arc_data` function now creates an `Arc` from the internal `data` of `MyStruct`. This enables multiple references to the same data and avoids relying on specific function parameter lifetimes. | **Lifetime Independence:** Callbacks are no longer restricted by the lifetimes of function parameters in `MyStruct`.|
|  This reference was limited by the lifetime (`'a`) of the function parameter used to access `MyStruct`.| **Modify CallbackData:** The `MyCallbackData` struct now holds an `Arc<[u8]>` instead of a direct reference. This allows callbacks to access the shared data encapsulated within the `Arc`. | **Shared Data Access:** Callbacks can access the same data concurrently through the `Arc` reference |
| Callbacks couldn't access the data independently due to these lifetime restrictions. | **Clone Arc for Callbacks:** Inside the `do_something` function, a clone of the `Arc` (`Arc::clone(&self.get_arc_data())`) is created for each callback. This ensures each callback gets a valid reference to the data without affecting the original `Arc`'s lifetime. |**Improved Flexibility:** `MyStruct` can be used in more dynamic scenarios with concurrent callbacks.  |

### Code Modification :
| Code | Old Structure | New Structure |
|--|--|--|
| `pub  data:  Arc<[u8]>, //data: &'a [u8],` | The structure previously used a lifetime `'a` to tie the lifetime of `data` (a slice of bytes) to that of `MyCallbackData`. | Now uses `Arc<[u8]>` to manage the data, removing the need for a specified lifetime and allowing the data to be shared safely across multiple instances with automatic reference counting. |
|  `impl CallbackData for MyCallbackData {} //impl<'a> CallbackData for MyCallbackData<'a> {}`| The implementation was tied to a specific lifetime `'a`.  | The lifetime specification is removed as `Arc` handles the lifetime management, simplifying the trait implementation. |
| `impl  MyTrait<MyCallbackData> for  MyStruct<MyCallbackData> { fn  set_callback(&mut  self, cb:  MyCallback<MyCallbackData>) {` | The method accepted callbacks specific to a lifetime `'a`. | With the removal of the explicit lifetime, the method now accepts callbacks that operate on any instance of `MyCallbackData`, regardless of its lifetime context. This broadens the usability of `set_callback`. |
| `data: Arc::clone(&self.get_arc_data()), //data: &self.data,`| Directly used a reference to `self.data`, which required careful lifetime management to ensure no dangling references. | Uses `Arc::clone` to safely share a reference to the data, guaranteeing that the data remains valid as long as there's at least one active reference, and avoiding issues related to data lifetime. |
| `impl<T: CallbackData> MyStruct<T> { fn get_arc_data(&self) -> Arc<[u8]> { Arc::new(self.data)}}` |  | This method wraps the static data array in an `Arc` at runtime, ensuring that any operation that accesses the data does so through a reference-counted pointer, which promotes safe concurrency and data sharing. |
